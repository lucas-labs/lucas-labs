$lucas.labs > whois
Hi, I’m Lucas Colombo, a full-stack Software Engineer from Argentina.
By day, I craft scalable solutions. By night… well, I’m still
coding—but now it’s just for fun

$lucas.labs > stack
Currently building with:
  - AI (teaching machines to think, kinda)
  - Rust ❤️ (for when I want my code to be fast and intimidating)
  - React, Next.js, & TypeScript (the "just one more library" trifecta)
  - Astro ❤️ (because stars and static sites are cool)
  - Python (when I need to get things done yesterday)
  - ...and really whatever gets the job done or catches my attention.

$lucas.labs > beyond_work  
When I’m not coding for work, I’m coding for fun—exploring new tools,
contributing to open-source, and experimenting with cool tech.

Currently, I'm actively helping maintaining the pupular
`material-extensions/vscode-material-icon-theme` vscode extension.
 
When I’m not coding, I’m either debugging, catching up on sleep,
or accidentally using my keyboard as a pillow (pro tip: the key
patterns make for a bold new look 😴).
